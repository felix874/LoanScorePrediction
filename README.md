As part of this applied data science consulting project, our team was tasked by a financial consulting firm to analyze a dataset of banking customers and apply machine learning techniques to generate actionable insights and build predictive models. The objective was to simulate a realistic mission that could be carried out for a financial institution looking to optimize credit risk management and decision-making processes.

Dataset Presentation

The dataset includes 100,000 anonymized customer records with a wide variety of features related to:

Payment behavior (e.g., Payment_Behaviour, Payment_of_Min_Amount)
Financial profile (Annual_Income, Outstanding_Debt, Credit_Utilization_Ratio)
Credit history and inquiries (Credit_History_Age, Num_Credit_Inquiries)
Loan information (Type_of_Loan, a multi-label textual field)
Investment patterns (Amount_invested_monthly)
The target variable: Credit_Score, categorized into Poor, Standard, and Good
Dataset Source

The dataset is inspired by publicly available financial data found on platforms such as World Bank Open Data, Data.gov, and other synthetic financial datasets. It is built to realistically simulate the financial and behavioral patterns of banking customers, with enough diversity and depth to support meaningful analysis.

Project Objective

The main goals of the project are to:

Predict a clientâ€™s credit score using a variety of financial, behavioral, and demographic features.
Explore the potential of textual and semi-structured data to enhance model accuracy and interpretability.
Extract insights that can support risk management and credit decision strategies in a banking context.
Why This Dataset is Interesting

This dataset stands out due to the following characteristics:

It covers multiple dimensions of customer profiles, allowing for a multi-faceted analysis.
It includes complex categorical and textual variables that challenge the way models handle real-world data.
It supports two clearly defined business questions:
One based on structured financial and behavioral data.
Another based on textual analysis of loan types and borrowing strategies.
It is large enough to support robust training and validation of machine learning models.
Mission Framework

As consultants working on behalf of a financial client, our mission involves:

Cleaning, exploring, and transforming the dataset.
Formulating two strategic business questions.
Building and evaluating appropriate machine learning models.
Presenting interpretable results through visualizations, metrics, and recommendations.
Delivering real business value through actionable insights that could inform credit risk policy and customer segmentation.
